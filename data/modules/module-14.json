OLAP: complex analytical queries across millions of rows (BI/dashboards).\n\n**3. What is the CAP theorem?**\nDistributed systems can guarantee at most 2 of 3: Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance. Since partitions happen, you choose CP or AP.\n\n**4. Batch vs streaming?**\nBatch: process data on a schedule (reports, ETL). Streaming: process in real-time as it arrives (fraud, live dashboards).\n\n**5. What is a feature store?**\nCentralized system for storing/serving ML features, ensuring consistency between training and production."

What does p = 0.04 mean?**\nIf H₀ were true (no effect), there's only a 4% chance of observing data this extreme. At α=0.05, we reject H₀.\n\n**13. Type I vs Type II?**\nType I (α) = false positive, crying wolf. Type II (β) = false negative, missing the wolf. Power = 1-β ≥ 0.80.\n\n**14. Why always switch in Monty Hall?**\nInitial pick = 1/3.

L1 vs L2: 300 features, you think ~20 matter.**\nL1 (Lasso) — drives irrelevant features to exactly zero. Built-in feature selection.\n\n**18. RF vs XGBoost: you have noisy data and 1 hour before deadline.**\nRandom Forest — good defaults, resistant to noise, hard to screw up. XGBoost needs tuning.\n\n**19. You built a fraud model with 99.5% accuracy. Your manager is impressed. Should you be?**\nNo — if fraud is 0.5% of transactions, predicting \"not fraud\" always = 99.5% accuracy. Check precision, recall, F1, PR-AUC.\n\n**20. Can you apply L1/L2 to Random Forest?**\nNo. L1/L2 regularize coefficients. Trees have none. Trees regularize via max_depth, min_samples_leaf, etc."

You need each employee's department average as a new column.** `agg()`, `transform()`, or `apply()`?\n`transform()` — keeps the same number of rows.\n\n**23. `df.loc[0:3]` returns how many rows?**\n4 rows (labels 0, 1, 2, 3 — loc is inclusive on both ends).\n\n**24. Why is NumPy faster than Python lists?**\nContiguous memory (cache-friendly), homogeneous types (no per-element type checking), vectorized C operations (no Python loop overhead). 10-100x faster.\n\n**25. List vs generator for 10M items?**\nGenerator — O(1) memory (yields one at a time) vs O(n) memory for list (stores all at once)."

Secondary — zero-result rate, avg result position clicked. Guardrail — page load time, user satisfaction\n- E: High clicks but low conversions = results look relevant but aren't. Track post-click behavior.\n\n**27. \"Revenue dropped 15% this quarter.\" First 3 things you do.**\n(1) Clarify: vs last quarter or YoY? All segments? (2) Decompose: Revenue = Users × Conversion × AOV — which dropped? (3) Check internal (deployments, bugs, logging changes) before external (seasonality, competitors).\n\n**28. Estimate: How many data scientists work in Chicago?**\n~5,000 companies with 500+ employees in Chicago. Maybe 30% have DS teams averaging ~5 DS each. 1,500 × 5 = ~7,500. Plus smaller companies and consultancies → maybe ~10-12K. (Rough but defensible.)"
