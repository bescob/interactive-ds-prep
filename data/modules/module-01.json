You can't filter a window function in WHERE — it's computed during SELECT. This execution order explains 90% of \"why doesn't this query work?\" moments.\n\n**Quick quiz — no peeking:**\nWhat happens if you write `WHERE total_sales > 100` and `total_sales` is an alias from `SELECT SUM(sales) AS total_sales`?\n\n**Answer:** It fails. WHERE runs before SELECT, so the alias doesn't exist yet. Use HAVING instead (runs after GROUP BY/aggregation)."

What's P(at least one 6)?\n\n**Answer:** 1 - P(no sixes) = 1 - (5/6 × 5/6) = 1 - 25/36 = **11/36 ≈ 0.306**"

Cheaper storage makes this viable.\n\n**Data Warehouse** = structured, processed data, optimized for analytical queries (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift). Think \"organized library.\"\n\n**Data Lake** = raw data in ANY format at any scale (S3, Azure Data Lake). Think \"dump everything, organize later.\" Risk: becomes a \"data swamp\" without governance.\n\n**Quick quiz:** Your company stores raw JSON logs from 50 different services. Where does this go — warehouse or lake?\n\n**Answer:** Data lake — it's raw, mixed-format data. After ETL/ELT processing, the cleaned structured version goes into the warehouse for analysis."

Sets use hash tables (compute hash, jump to bucket). Lists scan every element sequentially.\n3. P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) — subtract the overlap to avoid double-counting.\n4.
