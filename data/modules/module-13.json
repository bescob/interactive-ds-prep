Key differences:\n\n**17% more modeling questions** — they want to know you understand the algorithms, not just call `.fit()`.\n\n**Domain knowledge matters.** Discover wants credit risk intuition. AbbVie wants clinical trial awareness. McDonald's wants supply chain thinking. United wants demand forecasting context.\n\n**Take-home assignments are standard.** United gives 48hrs (intentionally open-ended). Grubhub gives 72hrs. Allstate has a transportation company case study.\n\n**STAR behavioral is used rigidly.** Allstate starts with 10 automated behavioral questions recorded by phone. AbbVie and Caterpillar use strict STAR rubrics.\n\n**Communication > algorithmic puzzles.** Explaining technical work to non-technical stakeholders is tested explicitly."

The first component captures the most, the second captures the most remaining variance perpendicular to the first, and so on.\n\n**Keep only the top k components** → reduce dimensions while retaining most information.\n\n**It's a rotation + projection, not feature selection.** Each component is a LINEAR COMBINATION of original features, not a single feature.\n\n**When to use:** High-dimensional data where features are correlated (100 survey questions → 5 underlying factors). Also for visualization (reduce to 2D/3D).\n\n**Quick quiz:** You have 200 features. After PCA, the first 15 components explain 95% of variance. What do you do?\n\n**Answer:** Keep 15 components, drop the rest. You've reduced from 200 to 15 dimensions while retaining 95% of the information. The remaining 185 components mostly capture noise."

What does `if __name__ == '__main__'` do?\n5. Recite the A/B test design steps from memory.\n6. Your SWE background — how is this an advantage for Chicago DS roles?\n\n**Answers:**\n1. More modeling questions (less LeetCode), domain knowledge heavily weighted, take-home assignments standard, rigid STAR behavioral.\n2. PCA finds new axes (principal components) that capture maximum variance, then keeps the top k. It's NOT feature selection — each component is a linear combination of ALL original features.\n3. HAVING — WHERE filters individual rows before grouping.\n4. Checks if the script is run directly (executes the code) vs imported as a module (skips the code).\n5. (1) Hypothesis (2) Metrics (primary/secondary/guardrail) (3) Sample size (4) Duration ≥2 weeks (5) Randomize by user (6) Analyze at end date — no peeking (7) Statistical + practical significance.\n6. Most Chicago DS candidates come from analytics/academia. Your ability to build end-to-end systems (pipelines, deployment, production code) is rare and highly valued. Lean into this in every behavioral."
