What's the problem and what do you try first?\n\n**Answer:** Overfitting (high variance) — 23% gap between train and test. Try: more training data, add regularization (L1/L2), reduce model complexity, or use dropout if neural net."

RF is harder to screw up — works well with defaults. XGBoost can outperform with careful tuning but can also overfit badly with wrong hyperparameters.\""
